## Crunchyroll video overlay visibility toggle

**Script Link**: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/479049-crunchyroll-video-overlay-visibility-toggle

This script adds an event listener to the Crunchyroll video player to allow toggling visibility. When focused on a Crunchyroll video player, press `h` to toggle overlay visibility _(toggle between `visible` and `hidden`)_. While the overlay is hidden the scrub-bar cannot be interacted with and clicking the video to pause it will not work. You can still use spacebar to play/pause the video when focused on the player.

I wrote this script because I tend to pause videos or move my mouse around a lot while watching anime on Crunchyroll and I found the dimmed background of the Crunchyroll video player overlay that sticks around for a while to be very distracting.
