# DEPRECATED
This script no longer works with Hidive's new interface. Hidive's new interface is pretty nice and doesn't require a script to hide the overlay, so I've gone ahead and removed this script off of greasyfork.

## HIDIVE video overlay visibility toggle

~~**Script Link**: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/479247-hidive-video-overlay-visibility-toggle~~

This script adds an event listener to Hidive stream pages to allow toggling video overlay visibility. When watching a video on Hidive, press `h` to toggle overlay visibility _(toggle between `visible` and `hidden`)_. While the overlay is hidden the scrub-bar and other elements cannot be interacted with. You can still click to play/pause the video.

I wrote this script because I tend to pause videos or move my mouse around a lot while watching anime and I found Hidive's scrub-bar to be pretty distracting, especially since it moves the subtitles up and down as it shows up and disappears. With the scrub-bar and other elements hidden, the subtitles moving about when pausing and playing is quite unnoticeable.
